# Trip Itinerary App

A trip itinerary planner using Google Sheets as a backend. FastAPI is used as a front-facing REST API to interface with Google Workspace APIs (Google Drive, Google Sheets). Requires authorized service account credentials for the Google Cloud Project to be stored at `credentials.json`. Includes a reference frontend app built with React.

â†— [Development of the frontend app](https://github.com/chrjl/itineraries--frontend)

## Run the dev server

Create and enter venv:

```console
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After [setting up the Google Cloud project](#setting-up-the-google-cloud-project):

- Save service account credentials to `credentials.json`.

Run the FastAPI dev server (default port 8000):

```console
fastapi dev main.py [--port PORT]
```

The API server is mounted to `/api`. View the API docs: `localhost[:PORT]/api/docs`

Static export of the reference [frontend app](https://github.com/chrjl/itineraries--frontend) is mounted to the server root. Run the app: `localhost[:PORT]`

## Setting up the Google Cloud Project

- Create Google Cloud Project
- Enable APIs: Google Drive API, Google Sheets API
- Create service account
- Create service account key

### Bootstrapping the project

All files created will be owned by the service account and stored in its Google Drive. Active itineraries will be stored in the `Itineraries` folder and archived itineraries will be stored in the `Itineraries/Archives` folder. A template spreadsheet stored in `Itineraries/Templates` will be used to create new itineraries. All folders need to be created and shared with the project owner.

A migration script performs the following:

- Create `Itineraries` folder.
- Share `Itineraries` folder with project owner. Permissions will propagate.
- Create `Archives` folder in `Itineraries` folder.
- Create `Templates` folder in `Itineraries` folder.
- Create `Itinerary` spreadsheet in `Templates` folder.

Run the migration script:

```console
python migration.py
```

## How it works

On startup, the FastAPI server requests creates a `Credentials` object out of the service account key file (default `credentials.json`) for use in calling Google APIs, then searches the service account's Google Drive for the required folders (`Itineraries`, `Archives`, `Templates`) and template (`Templates/Itinerary`) and stores the discovered File IDs.

Creating a new itinerary copies the template itinerary spreadsheet into a new spreadsheet in the active itineraries folder and shares it with the requester. Archiving an itinerary moves the itinerary spreadsheet into the archives folder. Archived spreadsheets can be permanently deleted, attempting to delete an active (non-archived) spreadsheet will fail.
